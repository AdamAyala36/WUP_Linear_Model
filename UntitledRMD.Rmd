```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
require(knitr)

data <- read.csv(file="https://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies_rvls/physical_strength/data.txt",sep="",header=TRUE)  
```

## Model 1 SIMS~ARM
### Scarttered Plot
```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))

```
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point() + ggtitle("SIMS vs ARM") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20))
```

The scatter plot made shows a positive correlation. Looks like those who do more simulations will have more arm strength although a majority of people are in middle between the numbers 50 and 100.

### Numerical Results

```{r}
cor(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```
These results being positive prove there is a positive correlation and with the number being closer to 1 means that there is something going on between the simulation and arm strength.
